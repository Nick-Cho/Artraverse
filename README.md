# Artraverse
Artraverse is a social media app that allows artists to more easily grow their platform through an intuitive interface. Artraverse was created out of my personal struggle to grow my art Instagram and Deviantart accounts due to lack of exposure. Through a home page that features the most recent posts made by its users, every artist has the oppurtunity to garner attention.

Artraverse was built using the MERN stack and Next.js
## Info
* Created an ExpressJS Restful API to handle frontend requests
* Live updates to the home page was facilitated through Socket.io to implement websockets.
* Authentication was handled using Bcrypt. Bcrypt encrypted password information to be securely stored in a MongoDB 
* Cloudinary API was used to facilitate image uploads.
* Bootstrap implemented to make webpage responsive
